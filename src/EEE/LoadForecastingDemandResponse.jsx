    question: "Which models are recommended for short- and mid-term load forecasting?",
    answer:
      "For short-term, start with ARIMA and gradient boosting baselines, then move to LSTM/GRU or CNNâ€‘BiLSTM hybrids for richer temporal patterns; for mid-term, consider hybrid ML with weather and calendar features, and attention mechanisms for multi-source signals."
  },
  {
    question: "What datasets are typically used for Mumbai-focused projects?",
    answer:
      "Smart meter data from housing societies, feeder/substation aggregates from utility partners, weather feeds (temperature, humidity, rainfall), calendar effects (holidays/events), and EV charging logs for transport-linked load spikes."
  },
  {
    question: "How to structure IEEE-aligned deliverables for forecasting and DR?",
    answer:
      "Include data curation/cleaning, feature engineering, model specs, training regime, baselines, ablation studies, uncertainty/error bands, MAPE/RMSE metrics, and a reproducibility section with code/configs and versioned artifacts."
  },
  {
    question: "Can demand response be tested without utility-side integration?",
    answer:
      "Yesâ€”use emulator setups with controllable loads (HVAC/heaters/EV emulators), tariff scenarios, and OpenADR-inspired signals to validate response strategies and quantify load shift/curtailment."
  },
  {
    question: "Which tools are most useful for rapid prototyping?",

      "Python (Pandas/Scikitâ€‘learn/TensorFlow), MATLAB/Simulink Power Systems, Power BI for dashboards, and lightweight SCADA simulators for signal orchestration and control loops."
