      <section id="why-proposal">
          <h3>1. Why a Research Proposal is the Cornerstone of Your PhD</h3>
          <p>A research proposal is both a contract and a blueprint. In Mumbai’s top universities—IIT Bombay, University of Mumbai, TISS, NMIMS, ICT, and VJTI—no doctoral seat is confirmed until the proposal passes multi-level scrutiny. It determines:</p>
        <div className="card-list">
         <div className="proposal-card">
           <h4>Admission Viability</h4>
             <p> Committees judge novelty, depth, and alignment with departmental thrust areas.</p>
          </div>

         <div className="proposal-card">
          <h4>Supervisor Interest</h4>
            <p> Professors accept students whose proposals fit current grants or lab equipment.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="proposal-card">
            <h4>Funding Approval</h4>
            <p> Bodies like UGC-JRF, CSIR, or industry partners demand a cost-justified plan.</p>
           </div>
        </div>

          <p>Our PhD research proposal writing services in Mumbai transform your raw idea into a persuasive, data-driven document that meets these expectations.</p>

        <section id="course-funding">
          <h3>2. How a Strong Proposal Guides Course, University & Funding Choices</h3>
          <p><strong>University Selection:</strong> Identifies departments whose projects and labs match your method (e.g., AI & Robotics at IIT-B’s S. J. Mehta School)</p>
          <p><strong>Course/Credit Planning:</strong> Maps research design to coursework—e.g., TISS requires two methodology credits aligned with your proposal</p>
          <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> TISS encourages scholars to cite at least one recent faculty publication to prove synergy.</p>
          <p><strong>Funding Acquisition:</strong> Breaks the budget into travel, instrumentation, fieldwork & contingency lines—mirroring DST format</p>
          <p>Through our PhD research proposal writing services in Mumbai, we embed these university-specific nuances so your proposal doubles as an admission and funding dossier.</p>

    <h2>⚠️ Mistakes Mumbai PhD Applicants Must Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ Copy-pasting “template” aims & objectives from seniors’ proposals.</li>
      <li>❌ Ignoring department style files (University of Mumbai’s 12 pt Times New Roman, 1.5 line spacing rule).</li>
      <li>❌ Skipping plagiarism screening—panels now run Turnitin even on proposals.</li>
      <li>❌ Budgeting costly imported equipment that already exists on campus.</li>
      <li>❌ Leaving the theoretical framework vague—especially penalized at TISS and SNDT.</li>
    </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Guide Alignment Sessions – IIT-B encourages a pre-proposal meeting; we simulate this with role-play interviews.</li>
            <li>Two-Page Executive Summary – TISS fast-tracks proposals with crisp summaries; we craft an elevator-pitch version.</li>
            <li>Budget-Milestone Correlation – NMIMS finance panel clears proposals faster when every expense ties to a milestone; we embed this table.</li>
            <li>Plagiarism Certificate – University of Mumbai demands &lt; 10% similarity; we supply Turnitin reports under 5%.</li>
