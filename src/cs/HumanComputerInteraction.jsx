              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), VR/AR Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023â€“2025) projects on HCI and immersive technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) are driving a paradigm shift in how humans engage with computing systems. HCI focuses on creating interfaces that are natural, adaptive, and accessible, while VR provides immersive artificial environments, and AR overlays digital information onto the physical world. Together, they transform user experiences into interactive, real-time engagements across industries.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Mumbai, where IT services, education, healthcare, real estate, and entertainment industries are booming, HCI and immersive technologies have emerged as strategic enablers of digital transformation. With growing investments in AR/VR startups, collaborations with global tech firms, and adoption in engineering education, Mumbai is becoming a hotspot for HCI-driven innovations.
