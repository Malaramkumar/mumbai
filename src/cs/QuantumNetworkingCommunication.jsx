            <section className="CSEProjectDevelopmentCenter-intro">
              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Quantum Networking / Communication Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023–2025) projects on quantum technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Quantum Networking / Communication is an emerging frontier of information technology that leverages quantum mechanics to achieve secure, ultra-fast, and interference-free communication. Unlike classical communication, which is based on bits, Quantum Networking / Communication transmits data using quantum states (qubits) that allow unique phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum teleportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                In cities like Mumbai, which host India’s top financial institutions, research centers, and multinational corporations, Quantum Networking / Communication is set to play a transformative role. It offers unbreakable encryption for banking, faster data transfer for high-performance computing, and secure cloud-based services. This makes Quantum Networking / Communication one of the most trending and high-potential research domains for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students.
