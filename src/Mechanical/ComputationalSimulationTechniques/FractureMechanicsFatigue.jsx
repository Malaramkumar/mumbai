            <section className="MEProjectDevelopmentCenter-intro">
              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Fracture Mechanics & Fatigue Analysis in Mechanical Systems Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023–2025) projects on fracture and fatigue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fracture Mechanics & Fatigue Analysis form the foundation of modern mechanical design, ensuring the durability, safety, and reliability of engineering systems subjected to repeated loads and stresses. Fracture mechanics studies the initiation and propagation of cracks in materials, while fatigue analysis investigates structural performance under cyclic loading. Together, they help predict failure mechanisms, extend product life, and optimize design standards across industries.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Mumbai, with its strong presence in automobile hubs (Tata Motors, Mahindra EV), aerospace manufacturing (HAL, Air India Engineering), marine systems (Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders), and heavy machinery industries (L&T, Reliance Engineering), fracture mechanics and fatigue analysis play a crucial role in real-world design validation.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Narpavi Research Institute, Mumbai, we provide IEEE-aligned project development for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students, combining theoretical understanding with industry-based case studies, advanced simulations, and testing techniques.
