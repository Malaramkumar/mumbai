              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Digital Twin & Smart Simulation in Mechanical Engineering Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023â€“2025) projects on digital twins and smart simulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Digital Twin & Smart Simulation have emerged as one of the most revolutionary technologies in mechanical engineering, bridging the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. A Digital Twin is a real-time, data-driven digital replica of a physical system that allows simulation, monitoring, and predictive maintenance. When integrated with smart simulation, it enables industries to optimize design, monitor performance, detect faults, and reduce costs by predicting failures before they occur.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Mumbai, which is home to major hubs of automobile engineering (Tata Motors, Mahindra EV), aerospace development (HAL, Air India Engineering), oil & gas refineries (BPCL, HPCL), shipbuilding (Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders), and manufacturing industries (L&T, Reliance Engineering), the adoption of Digital Twin & Smart Simulation is accelerating.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the Narpavi Research Institute, Mumbai, we provide IEEE-aligned project development for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students, ensuring hands-on expertise in digital twin creation, real-time monitoring, IoT data integration, and predictive analytics using advanced platforms.
