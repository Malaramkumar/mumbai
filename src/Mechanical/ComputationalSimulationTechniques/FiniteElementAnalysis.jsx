              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) Applications Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023‚Äì2025) projects on FEA simulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical simulation technique used to analyze structural, thermal, fluid, and multi-physics problems. It divides complex geometries into smaller finite elements, enabling precise computation of stress, strain, deformation, heat transfer, vibration, and fatigue life. FEA has become a cornerstone of modern mechanical engineering, supporting industries in product validation, optimization, and cost reduction.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Mumbai‚Äôs growing industrial and research ecosystem, FEA applications are widely adopted in automotive, aerospace, marine, energy, biomedical, and manufacturing industries. Organizations increasingly rely on simulation-driven design before prototyping, making FEA an essential skillset for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. scholars.
              </p>
              <p>
