            <h1>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) – Project Development Support in Mumbai</h1>

            <section className="MEProjectDevelopmentCenter-intro">
              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023–2025) projects on ITS technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) represent a paradigm shift in the way transportation networks are designed, operated, and optimized. ITS leverages artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), wireless communication, cloud computing, big data analytics, and machine learning to enhance traffic management, public safety, logistics efficiency, and urban sustainability.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a highly populated and industrialized region like Mumbai, where transportation networks are under continuous strain due to population growth, port-related logistics, and commercial vehicle density, ITS serves as the backbone of future-ready mobility solutions. ITS not only minimizes congestion but also addresses road safety, fuel efficiency, environmental impact, and multi-modal connectivity, making it integral to India’s Smart City mission.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Narpavi Research Institute, we support B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students in developing ITS-aligned projects drawn from IEEE transactions and recent publications. Our Project Development Center combines theoretical rigor with practical industrial applications, ensuring that students create globally competitive research outcomes.
