              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Industrial & Collaborative Robots Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023‚Äì2025) projects on industrial articulated robots, collaborative robots (cobots), SCARA robots, delta robots, mobile collaborative robots, and humanoid robots.
              </p>
              <p>
                Industrial & Collaborative Robots are revolutionizing modern manufacturing by combining precision, flexibility, and safety. Unlike traditional industrial robots that work in isolated zones, collaborative robots (cobots) are designed to operate safely alongside humans, enhancing productivity, reducing costs, and enabling advanced automation. Their adaptability makes them central to Industry 4.0, smart factories, and robotics-driven manufacturing ecosystems. Our projects leverage Arduino, Raspberry Pi, SolidWorks, MATLAB, ROS (Robot Operating System), Gazebo, MATLAB/Simulink, Python, and machine learning libraries to address challenges in these sectors, ensuring high-impact research and industrial applicability in Mumbai‚Äôs vibrant industrial hub.
              </p>
              <p>
                By emphasizing Industrial & Collaborative Robots, we highlight their transformative role in advancing automation and human-robot collaboration.
