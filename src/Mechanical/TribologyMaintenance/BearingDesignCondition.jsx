              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Bearing Design & Condition Monitoring Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023‚Äì2025) projects on bearing design, lubrication strategies, and intelligent condition monitoring systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bearing Design & Condition Monitoring is at the heart of mechanical systems, ensuring smooth operation, reduced friction, and extended equipment lifespan. With applications ranging from automotive engines to aerospace turbines and heavy industrial machinery, bearings determine the efficiency, reliability, and performance of rotating equipment. Condition monitoring enhances this by using sensors, vibration analysis, oil monitoring, and AI-based diagnostics to predict and prevent failures.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the Narpavi Research Institute, Mumbai, we support B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students with IEEE-aligned projects in bearing design, lubrication strategies, and intelligent condition monitoring systems, integrating simulation tools, IoT, and machine learning approaches.
