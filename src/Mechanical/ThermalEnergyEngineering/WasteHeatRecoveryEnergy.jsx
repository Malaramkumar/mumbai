              <p>
                <strong>Narpavi Research Institute</strong> presents the Waste Heat Recovery & Energy Conservation Project Development Center in Mumbai, a global platform for B.Tech, M.Tech, and Ph.D. students to develop IEEE-aligned (2023‚Äì2025) projects on heat exchanger networks, thermoelectric generators, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems, and energy conservation techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                Waste Heat Recovery & Energy Conservation is becoming one of the most crucial engineering domains for addressing the challenges of global warming, rising fuel costs, and sustainable development. In a fast-growing metropolitan city like Mumbai, industries such as power plants, steel production, cement factories, automotive manufacturing, and commercial HVAC consume enormous energy, with significant amounts lost as waste heat. By adopting advanced Waste Heat Recovery & Energy Conservation techniques, these industries can cut costs, increase efficiency, and reduce carbon emissions. Our projects leverage ANSYS Fluent, COMSOL Multiphysics, MATLAB, SolidWorks, and experimental setups to address challenges in industrial boilers, automotive, cement, and smart city energy systems, ensuring high-impact research and industrial applicability in Mumbai‚Äôs vibrant industrial hub.
              </p>
              <p>
                By repeating this domain throughout the project framework, we ensure that students build solutions that align with industry needs and academic excellence.
