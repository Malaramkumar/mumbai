    question: "What makes Narpavi's Bridge Design & Monitoring center in Mumbai unique?",
    answer: "Our Mumbai center focuses on the specific challenges of designing and maintaining bridges in a dense, coastal urban environment. We combine advanced software like STAAD.Pro and ANSYS with hands-on experience in IoT-based structural health monitoring, preparing students to work on critical infrastructure like the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link [109]."
  },
  {
    question: "Which software and tools are used for these bridge projects?",
    answer: "We use a comprehensive suite of industry-standard tools, including STAAD.Pro and SAP2000 for structural design and analysis, ANSYS and ABAQUS for detailed Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and BIM software for integrated project management. For monitoring, we use IoT sensors and drone technology."
  },
  {
    question: "How do these projects address real-world challenges in Mumbai?",
    answer: "Projects are tailored to solve local problems, such as designing corrosion-resistant bridges for the coastal environment, optimizing traffic flow on high-traffic flyovers, and implementing real-time monitoring to prevent structural failures, reflecting the city's ongoing infrastructure upgrades [112]."
  },
  {
    question: "What are some advanced topics covered in M.Tech and Ph.D. research?",
    answer: "M.Tech and Ph.D. scholars explore cutting-edge areas like AI-based defect detection from drone imagery, developing self-healing concrete for enhanced durability, and creating quantum-inspired algorithms for ultra-fast stress simulations, pushing the boundaries of smart infrastructure."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there support for publishing my research in high-impact journals?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We provide end-to-end guidance for publishing in prestigious IEEE, Scopus, and SCI-indexed journals. Our mentorship covers everything from research ideation and data analysis to manuscript preparation and navigating the peer-review process."
