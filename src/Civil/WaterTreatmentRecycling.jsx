  {
    question: "What are some real-world applications of these technologies in Mumbai?",
    answer: "These technologies are widely used in Mumbai. The BMC is implementing desalination projects, advanced Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) are used in STPs in Navi Mumbai and Thane, and many new real estate projects are integrating greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting systems [177][179]."
  },
  {
    question: "What specific technologies are covered in Narpavi's projects?",
    answer: "Our projects explore a range of advanced water treatment technologies, including Reverse Osmosis (RO) for desalination, Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) for wastewater recycling, Activated Carbon Filtration for industrial effluents, and IoT-based systems for real-time water quality monitoring [174]."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of innovative research can Ph.D. scholars pursue in this field?",
    answer: "Ph.D. research focuses on cutting-edge topics such as developing AI models for predicting water quality, creating digital twins for real-time monitoring of treatment plants, designing hybrid nanomaterial membranes for advanced purification, and developing bio-electrochemical systems for energy recovery from wastewater [181]."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Narpavi offer support for publishing research in water engineering?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide comprehensive guidance for publishing in high-impact journals.
