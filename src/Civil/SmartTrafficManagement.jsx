    question: "Why are Smart Traffic Management Systems crucial for Mumbai?",
    answer: "Smart Traffic Management Systems (STMS) are crucial for Mumbai to combat its severe traffic congestion, reduce travel times, and improve road safety. By integrating AI, IoT, and real-time data analytics, these systems optimize traffic flow on the city's dense road networks, aligning with its Smart City mission [149]."
  },
  {
    question: "What real-world STMS implementations are happening in and around Mumbai?",
    answer: "Authorities are actively deploying Intelligent Traffic Management Systems (ITMS) on major arteries like the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and Samruddhi Mahamarg. These systems use AI-powered cameras to detect violations like speeding and lane cutting, automatically issuing e-challans to improve driver discipline and reduce accidents [147][148]."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies are covered in Narpavi's STMS projects?",
    answer: "Our projects cover a wide range of modern technologies, including IoT sensors for real-time data collection, machine learning for predictive traffic flow analysis, computer vision for vehicle detection, and cloud computing for centralized data management and control [152]."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of projects can B.Tech and M.Tech students undertake?",
    answer: "B.Tech students can work on foundational projects like Arduino-based smart signals or IoT traffic density monitors. M.Tech students can tackle more advanced topics, such as developing AI-based traffic prediction models or designing intelligent parking allocation systems for suburban areas."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Narpavi support Ph.D. research in this domain?",
    answer: "For Ph.D. scholars, we support cutting-edge research in areas like developing city-wide AI-IoT traffic management architectures, creating cloud-based decision support systems for urban mobility, and designing multi-objective optimization models for smart traffic policies, with full guidance for publication in top IEEE journals."
