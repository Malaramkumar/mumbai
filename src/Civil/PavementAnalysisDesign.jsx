    question: "Why is Pavement Analysis & Design a critical area for Mumbai?",
    answer: "In Mumbai, high traffic volumes and heavy monsoon rainfall create immense stress on road networks. Advanced pavement design is essential to build durable, safe, and cost-effective roads that can withstand these conditions, reducing maintenance frequency and improving commuter experience."
  },
  {
    question: "What modern pavement technologies are covered in your projects?",
    answer: "Our projects explore cutting-edge technologies, including Mechanistic-Empirical (ME) design for performance prediction, the use of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) for sustainability, and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) for detailed stress-strain analysis. We also cover smart monitoring with tools like Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)."
  },
  {
    question: "Which software tools are used for Pavement Analysis & Design projects?",
    answer: "Students gain hands-on experience with industry-standard software such as AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design, PAVEXpress for flexible pavement design, and advanced FEA tools like ANSYS and Abaqus for detailed simulation [156][160]. We also use GIS tools for network-level planning."
  },
  {
    question: "What are some innovative research topics for M.Tech and Ph.D. scholars?",
    answer: "Advanced research focuses on developing AI-driven pavement distress prediction models, creating nano-modified bituminous binders for enhanced durability, designing digital twins for real-time condition monitoring, and optimizing the use of recycled materials for green pavement solutions."
